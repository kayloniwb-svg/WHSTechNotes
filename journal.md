 New laws limiting cell phone use while driving, such as hands-free mandates and full handheld bans, are an essential public safety measure proven to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities.  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), studies in states that enacted handheld cell phone bans have shown a reduction in motor vehicle-related emergency department visits. Furthermore, data collected by organizations like the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) consistently show that handheld bans, which are easier to enforce than texting-only bans, lead to a measurable decrease in drivers using their phones.  These findings directly support the claim that stricter cell phone laws increase safety by forcing drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and their attention focused solely on the road. Distracted driving, often caused by cell phone use, significantly impairs a driver's reaction time and cognitive function, making them a hazard to themselves and others. By legally prohibiting this dangerous behavior, states effectively mandate safer driving habits, leading to a demonstrable improvement in overall road safety statistics and preventing preventable tragedies.
